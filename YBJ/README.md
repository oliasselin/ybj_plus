# QG-YBJ+ model

This is a numerical model for the two-way interaction of near-inertial waves with (Lagrangian-mean) balanced eddies. Wave evolution is governed by the YBJ+ equation (Asselin & Young 2019). The traditional quasigeostrophic equation dictates the evolution of potential vorticity, which includes the wave feedback term of Xie & Vanneste (2015). The model is pseudo-spectral in the horizontal and uses second-order finite differences to evaluate vertical and time derivatives.
